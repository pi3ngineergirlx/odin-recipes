        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>
            Pickled ginger is a condiment made from young ginger root that has been
            marinated in a sweet and tangy vinegar solution. It is often served with
            sushi and sashimi, but can also be enjoyed as a palate cleanser or a side
            dish. It has a spicy and sweet taste and often tastes optimal with lemons.
